\title{Differentially Private ANOVA}
\author{Zachary Campbell}
\maketitle


The setting is that we have a dataset of $k$ groups, each populated with 
an arbitrary number of individuals. The goal of ANOVA is to test if there 
is a statistical difference between the means of these groups. This test 
is ubiquitous in the social sciences, as well as in biology. Our goal is to 
develop a framework for executing ANOVA tests in a differentially 
private manner, as the data being evaluated is often sensitive. To that 
end, we will define the specific terms of an ANOVA.
\\
\\
Let $\mathcal{D}_i$, $i\in\{1,...,k\}$ be our groups. Then our database is 
$\mathcal{D} = \{D_i \; |\; 1\leq k\leq k \}$. We will denote entries 
$y_{ij}$, which says that this is the $j$th entry in the $i$th group. Let 
$x_i = |D_i|$, $y_{ij}\in [0,1]$, $\overline{y_i}$ the mean of $D_i$, and 
$\overline{y}$ the mean of all $\overline{y_i}$ (the mean of means). We will 
not assume that every group has the same size. There are three important 
quantities in the ANOVA framework:
\[
\text{SST} = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^{x_i} (y_{ij} - \overline{y})^2;
\]

\[
\text{SSA} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^{x_i}(\overline{y_i} - \overline{y})^2;
\]

\[
\text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^{x_i} (y_{ij} - \overline{y_i})^2.
\]

These are the sum of squares total, treatment, and error, respectively. 
We further define two more terms: $\text{MSA} := \frac{\text{SSA}}{k-1}$, 
and $\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{x_i - 1} 
\sum_{j=1}^{x_i} (y_{ij} - \overline{y_i})^2$.
